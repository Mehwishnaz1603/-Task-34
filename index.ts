     //Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names 
//in a array, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
//â€¢ Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing 
//just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a 
//simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza
